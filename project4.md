# MEAN STACK DEPLOYMENT TO UBUNTU IN AWS

I THINK I FOUND PROJECT 4 MORE EASIER THAN THE OTHERS,I WAS ABLE TO IMPLEMENT THIS WITH HE HELP OF TH VIDEO AND WITHOUT REACHING OUT TO ANYONE

## MEAN Stack is a combination of following components:
MongoDB (Document database) – Stores and allows to retrieve data.
Express (Back-end application framework) – Makes requests to Database for Reads and Writes.
Angular (Front-end application framework) – Handles Client and Server Requests
Node.js (JavaScript runtime environment) – Accepts requests and displays results to end user

I CREATED MY INSTANCE AS USUAL AND CONNECTED IT TO MY TERMINAL. THEN I FOLLOWED THE DOCUMENTATION ON THE DAREY.IO SITE.

I INSTALLED SOME APPLICATIONS, INSTALLING MONGODB WAS STRESSFUL BECAUSE I HAD TO GO ON GOOGLE SINCE THE DAREY.IO SITE IS NOT LETTING ME.
